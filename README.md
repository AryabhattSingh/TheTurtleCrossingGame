# Project: The Turtle Crossing Game

Welcome to the Turtle Crossing Game! This simple yet addictive game is built using Python's Turtle module and provides hours of fun as you help a determined turtle cross a busy road. Here's everything you need to know about the game:

## Game Overview

- **Game Window**: The game window is set to a size of 600x600 pixels, providing a visually appealing and immersive experience.

- **Turtle Hero**: You control a brave turtle that appears at the bottom of the screen. This turtle can only travel in an upward direction.

- **Scoreboard**: The current level of the game is displayed in the scoreboard at the top left edge of the game window. Your goal is to advance through the levels by safely guiding the turtle across the road.

- **Traffic Challenge**: Randomly generated cars, each with dimensions of 40x20 pixels, appear at the right edge of the game window. These cars start traveling from right to left, moving 5 paces at a time in Level 1.

- **Level Progression**: As you progress through the game, the speed of the cars increases. Each new level increases the car speed by 10 paces per level. Keep an eye on the scoreboard to track your progress.

## How to Play

Your objective is straightforward:

- Safely guide the turtle across the busy road without allowing it to be squished by any of the cars.

- If the turtle successfully crosses the road, you advance to the next level, and the game continues with increased challenges.

- However, if the turtle collides with any of the cars, it's game over, and you can restart to try and beat your high score.

## Technical Details

Here are some technical details about the game implementation:

- **Game Window**: The game window is created using the `Screen` class from the Turtle module, providing an interactive and visually appealing environment.

- **Turtle Character**: The turtle character in the game is represented using the `Turtle` class from the Turtle module.

- **Scoreboard**: The scoreboard displaying the current level is also an object of the `Turtle` class, making it easy to update and display your progress.

- **Cars**: Each of the cars that appear on the road is represented by an object of the `Turtle` class. While their default dimensions are 20x20 pixels, they appear as 40x20 pixels due to their elongated shape. The colors of these cars are selected randomly from a predefined list, adding variety to the game.

- **Car Movement**: Cars move in a backward direction as they were created at the rightmost edge of the game window. This movement creates the illusion that they are traveling from right to left.

- **Turtle Controls**: The movement of the turtle is defined using the `screen.listen()` function, which binds the up arrow key with the `move()` function defined in the `Player` class. This allows you to control the turtle's upward movement using the keyboard.

Get ready to test your reflexes and strategic thinking in the Turtle Crossing Game. Have fun and see how many levels you can conquer!
